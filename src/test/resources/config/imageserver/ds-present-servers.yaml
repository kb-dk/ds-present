config:

  # Image server URLs are injected into transformations.
  # These should be overridden in environment specific config files for all environments, meaning local test,
  # shared devel, stage and production
  #
  # Sample override:
  #
  # config:
  #   imageservers:
  #     devel:
  #       url: "https://example.com/devel/iipimage"
  #       default: true
  #
  # Note: The server marked with "default: true" is used in the base configuration ds-present-kb-collections.yaml
  imageservers:
    invalid:
      # Maps are merged, not overwritten, when using multiple YAMLs (not sure this is the best behaviour)
      # so the "invalid" imageserver from behaviour needs to be marked as no longer being the default
      default: false
    local:
      # This overrides the one in ds-present-behavious
      url: "the_right_url"
      default: true
