# This contains behaviour data: Thread allocation, allowed fields for lookup, limits for arguments etc.
#
# The behaviour config is normally controlled by developers and is part of the code repository.
# Sensitive information such as machine names and user/passwords should not be part of this config.
#
# It will be automatically merged with the environment config when accessed through the
# application config system.
#
#


# Image server URLs are injected into transformations.
# These should be overridden in environment specific config files for all environments, meaning local test,
# shared devel, stage and production
#
# Sample override:
#

# imageservers:
#   devel:
#     url: "https://example.com/devel/iipimage"
#     default: true
#
# Note: The server marked with "default: true" is used in the base configuration ds-present-kb-collections.yaml
imageservers:
  # Note: The servers are in a list to ensure the full list of servers can be fully overwritten in subsequent configs
  - example:
      url: "https://example.com"

  - invalid:
      url: "invalid://url"
      # The default is commented out here to force defining a default for a real imageserver in the local, devel or prod config
      #default: true

# Values in the openapi part of the configuration are expected to be overwritten with the actual values used for deployment.
# These values are used to populate the OpenAPI specification without redeploying the service. They can be served by using the syntax ${config:yaml.path}.
openapi:
  serverurl: http://localhost:9073/ds-present/v1

# The oldimageserver is special as that is used for imageIdentifier rather that bitmap delivery
oldimageserver:
  url: "http://kb-images.kb.dk"

streamingserver:
  url: "http://example.com/streaming/"

# Used for verifying access to metadata https://github.com/kb-dk/ds-license
# If allowall is set to true (default is false), all access is granted. Use only for devel + stage
licensemodule:
  url: http://localhost:9076/ds-license/v1
  allowall: false

# List of backing storages. This information should be overridden in ds-present-environment.yaml

# The storages defined in this file are
# * ds-storage, expecting https://github.com/kb-dk/ds-storage/ to be running locally with the default port
# * folder, serving sample files
storages:
  # There can be multiple defined storages. The outer YAML key is used as the ID for the storage.

      # the implementation (aka type) of the backend

  - test:
      # If there is more that one backend implementation, the property 'order' controls how they are queried:
      # * parallel:   All backends are queried in parallel. Whoever answers with a record first wins.
      # * sequential: All backends are queried one at a time in the order in this configuration.
      #               When a backend responds with a record, itertaion is stopped and the record is returned
      # Optional, default value is 'sequential'
